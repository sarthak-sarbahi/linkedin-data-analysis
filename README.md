# My LinkedIn Data Analysis
I wanted to explore my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sarthaksarbahi/) data, so I exported it from the website in the form of a CSV file and performed some analysis.

### Exporting LinkedIn Data
Your LinkedIn data belongs to you hence you can export it anytime. You can download the following data from LinkedIn:
* Articles
* Connections
* Imported Contacts
* Messages
* Invitations
* Profile
* Recommendations
* Registration

### Exporting LinkedIn Connections Data
To download my connections data (**7,793** connections as of **6th September, 2020**), I followed the steps [here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/66844/export-connections-from-linkedin?lang=en). It takes some time for LinkedIn to get ready with your data in downloadable format. The CSV I finaly downloaded was in the following format:

**Columns**|**Description**
------|---------
First Name|First name of connection
Last Name|Last name of connection
Email Address|Email address of connection
Company|Current company/organisation of connection
Position|Current professional position of connection
Connection On|Date of connection establishment

### Data Analysis - Insights Obtained
* My first connection was **Soumik Mallik** and we got connected on **17th November, 2016**
* Highest number of connection requests accepted on **11th August, 2018** - **444**
* Organisations/Companies from where I have maximum connections (Top 5 and Highest to Lowest) - **Merkle Sokrati**, **Manipal University Jaipur**, **Amazon**, **Udaan.com** & **Simplilearn**
